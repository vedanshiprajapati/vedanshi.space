## The Netflix Approach to Side Projects

Open my GitHub and you’ll see it: a digital graveyard of half-finished ideas. There’s a landing page for a tool I never launched, a Supabase thing I swore I’d “circle back to,” and one repo simply titled `test-final-v2-fixed-new` (don’t judge me).

For the longest time, this clutter made me feel like a failure. Why couldn’t I just finish what I started?

And then it hit me — what if side projects aren’t meant to be finished?  
What if they're meant to be enjoyed?

What if I treated them like TV shows?

## Episode 1: The Pilot

Every project starts with a vibe. Maybe it's a name, maybe it's a UI idea, or maybe it's a random urge to clone something and "make it better."

This is your **pilot episode**. You set up Tailwind. Install shadcn/ui. Deploy something empty to Vercel just to feel productive.  
You’re excited. You’re moving fast. You don’t even know what the project _is_ yet — and that’s the best part.

The pilot isn’t supposed to be perfect. It’s just there to help you decide if the idea deserves more time.

What I do in the pilot:

- Hack together a rough UI in one sitting
- Test core logic (auth? DB? whatever’s exciting)
- Pause when I’ve “seen enough” to decide

If it’s fun, I greenlight Season 1.  
If it’s not, I cancel the show. No shame. Just vibes.

## Season 1: The Hook

If the pilot had potential, Season 1 is where I build the MVP. A few meaningful features, nothing bloated. Enough to:

- Share with friends
- Use it personally
- Or just feel proud that it _works_

I resist the urge to over-engineer. Season 1 is supposed to be short, scrappy, and experimental.

How I keep it fun:

- Break tasks into “episodes”:  
  _S01E02: Dark Mode Unlocked_,  
  _S01E03: Group Chat Drama_
- Write commits like a script
- Focus on what’s _fun_, not what’s “required”

This narrative style keeps me invested. I don’t burn out — I binge-build.

## The Mid-Season Cliffhanger

You know that moment when everything _kinda_ works, but things are getting... weird?

Maybe you’re considering a new stack. Maybe you opened one too many “refactor auth” tabs. Maybe you haven’t touched it in 3 weeks and don’t remember the file structure.

That’s your **mid-season cliffhanger**.

Now you have three options:

- Rewrite the whole thing for no reason
- Add 10 more features you don’t need
- Ghost the repo until next year

There’s no wrong answer.

TV shows go on hiatus all the time.  
So can your projects.

---

## The Cancelled Shows Shelf

Some projects will never see a second season. And that’s okay.

Not every repo needs to be a product. Some are just pilots that helped you learn:

- A new database
- A better file structure
- Or that you _hate_ dealing with OAuth

I keep a folder called `cancelled/` in my projects directory. No drama, no regrets. These are my little art experiments. They served their purpose.

---

## Renewals and Reboots

Every now and then, I stumble across an old repo and think, “Wait... this still kinda slaps.”

That’s a **renewal**.

Maybe the idea finally clicks. Maybe you’ve grown as a dev. Maybe you’re just bored.  
Whatever the reason — it’s back.

I open a new branch. Clean up the mess. Rename it. Start fresh.

It’s the same project, but with better pacing and a stronger plot.

Just like _Gilmore Girls_.

---

## Finales, Not Forever

I’ve stopped trying to make my side projects “ongoing.”  
Now I build mini-series.

If I:

- Solved a real problem
- Learned something new
- Blogged it or shipped a v1

That’s a wrap. Season complete. Time to archive and move on.

Because you know what?  
**A finished season is better than an endless rewrite.**

## Treat Projects Like Stories

Once I started thinking of my codebase like a storyline, everything changed.

| Old Mindset                    | New Mindset                          |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| “I never finish my projects.”  | “That season was fun. What’s next?”  |
| “Should I keep working on it?” | “Is this story still worth telling?” |
| “Why so many repos?”           | “Each project had its own arc.”      |

Not everything needs to scale. Some things just need to make sense — for now.

---

## TL;DR: What This Mindset Gave Me

- Creative framing that keeps burnout away
- Natural reflection points (episodes, finales, reboots)
- Permission to pause or cancel guilt-free
- Faster experimentation, less pressure

---

So next time you spin up a new project, give it a show title. Write a pilot. Ship an episode. Let it breathe.

And when someone asks, “Why don’t you finish your side projects?”

Just say:

> “It’s on hiatus. Season 2 drops soon.”  
> 🎥✨
